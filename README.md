# Jarvis

As a huge Marvel fan, I decided to create my own Jarvis, from Iron man. I have already programmed many actions for Jarvis, in order to help me with my everyday life.\
The GUI is in a very initial state, as I put most of the time in his basic program.
Also, some services only work for me as I have my personal data. I will add a new user function. For now, you can browse the code and put your data (email, directories etc).\

Here are some services Jarvis can offer:\
1) Face Recognition\
2) Greet you based on the time of day\
3) Create word, pdf and txt files\
4) Open any file from any directory\
5) Google search\
6) Play YouTube videos\
7) Send emails\

## Setup
### Step 1
After you have cloned the repo, open the project and run the "setup.py" script.\
This installs all the necessary libraries.

### Step 2
From the "faceRecognition.py" script, run the "captureFaces()" function, in order to save your profile photos in the faces/me folder.\
These will be used by Jarvis to do a face recognition on you.

### Step 3
Run Jarvis, ask him what he can do and enjoy!

### Important note
In order for Jarvis to send emails using your own email address, follow this guide: https://realpython.com/python-send-email/
